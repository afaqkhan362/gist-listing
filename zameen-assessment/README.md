### Improvements in the Project

Since the project is performed and created by just implementing the basic business logic or requirements, it has alot of missing features that can be improved, e-g.

1. Styling for each un ordered list can be styled in a table form and all of the data can be displayed separately and thus the UX can be improved with that.
2. Instead of opening the file in the window, we can use some library for tool text sort of functionality to display the file data in the same window.
3. The alignment of the data presented can be improved using the styling and css. Since i am new to designing i didn't focus on UX/UI
4. we can show the pagination provided by the git by showing the results option for each page and displaying next and previous buttons for further results.
